The beating heart pendant is a small attiny85 driven pendant that I'm using to learn Eagle CAD, the Bantam Othermill, and general circuit board design.

I'm still working on the design and assembly portion of the project. As I 3D model the case and cover I'll add the models and dxfs necessary to build the entire pendant.
